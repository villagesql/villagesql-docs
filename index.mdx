## What is VillageSQL Server?

VillageSQL is the innovation platform for MySQL and a new path for MySQL in the agentic AI era. VillageSQL Server for MySQL is an open-source, drop-in replacement, and extensible tracking fork of MySQL. It introduces a robust extension framework that supports custom data types and custom functions (with custom indexes coming soon). VillageSQL's mission is to empower the MySQL community by enabling permissionless innovation.

## Extensions for MySQL
VillageSQL is a drop-in replacement for MySQL but adds on the ability to load extensions that modify the server's behavior. Extensions support:
- **Custom Data Types:** Extensions can define new types (e.g., `UUID`, `COMPLEX`, `INET6`) that behave like native types.
- **Custom Functions:** Add high-performance C++ functions callable from SQL.
- **Seamless Integration:** Extensions are managed via simple SQL commands (`INSTALL EXTENSION`, `UNINSTALL EXTENSION`).

### Built-in Extensions
VillageSQL Server 0.0.2 includes two built-in extensions when building from source:
- **`vsql_complex`**: adds support for complex number data type
- **`vsql_simple`**: demonstrates building custom types and functions

Additional extensions are available in separate repositories:
- [**`vsql_uuid`**](https://github.com/villagesql/vsql-uuid): UUID generation, validation, conversion, and comparison
- [**`vsql_ai`**](https://github.com/villagesql/vsql-ai): AI prompting via SQL functions
- [**`vsql_crypto`**](https://github.com/villagesql/vsql-crypto): Cryptographic functions (hashing, encryption, random data generation)
- [**`vsql_network_address`**](https://github.com/villagesql/vsql-network-address): IPv4, IPv6, and MAC address types

### Build an Extension
You can build your own extension using this [template](https://github.com/villagesql/vsql-extension-template).
