## Built-in Extensions

<Warning>
  When building from source, only `vsql_complex` and `vsql_simple` are included. Other extensions are maintained in separate repositories (linked below).
</Warning>

### vsql_complex

**Status:** Built-in with VillageSQL
**Repository:** [villagesql-server/villagesql/examples/vsql-complex](https://github.com/villagesql/villagesql-server/tree/main/villagesql/examples/vsql-complex)

Complex number data type with full arithmetic support for electrical engineering, signal processing, and scientific computing.

**Features:**
- `COMPLEX` column type for storing complex numbers (a + bi)
- Constructor: `COMPLEX(real, imaginary)`
- Arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Utilities: `complex_real()`, `complex_imag()`, `complex_abs()`, `complex_conjugate()`
- Binary storage: 16 bytes (2 doubles)

**Installation:**
```sql
INSTALL EXTENSION vsql_complex;
```

**Example Usage:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE signals (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    impedance COMPLEX,
    frequency_response COMPLEX
);

INSERT INTO signals VALUES
    (1, COMPLEX(50.0, 0.0), COMPLEX(0.95, 0.31));

SELECT
    complex_abs(impedance) as magnitude,
    complex_add(impedance, frequency_response) as total
FROM signals;
```

## Installing Built-in Extensions

Built-in extensions are ready to install:

```sql
INSTALL EXTENSION extension_name;
```

**For source builds:** Only `vsql_complex` and `vsql_simple` are included by default. To use external extensions, build them from their GitHub repositories (links above) and copy the `.veb` files to your VEF directory (see [Installing External Extensions](/mysql-8.4/0.0.1/install#installing-external-extensions)).

See [Installing Extensions](/mysql-8.4/0.0.1/install) for detailed instructions.
