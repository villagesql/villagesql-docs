Get a VillageSQL Server instance running, connect to it, and try out the extension system.

## Step 1: Clone and Build from Source

VillageSQL Server must be built from source for the initial alpha release.

Follow the [Clone and Build from Source Guide](/mysql-8.4/0.0.1/source) to compile from the latest code.

## Step 2: Connect to the Server

Once your server is running, you can connect to it using any standard MySQL client.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

## Step 3: Install Your First Extension

You can dynamically load extensions to add new data types and features.

Install the `vsql_complex` extension to add support for complex numbers.

1.  **Check currently installed extensions:**
    ```sql
    SHOW EXTENSIONS;
    ```

2.  **Install the extension:**
    ```sql
    INSTALL EXTENSION 'vsql_complex';
    ```

3.  **Verify installation:**
    ```sql
    SHOW EXTENSIONS;
    ```
    You should see `vsql_complex` listed with status `ACTIVE`.

## Step 4: Use Extended Data Types

Now that the extension is active, you can use the `COMPLEX` data type in your tables just like native types.

```sql
-- Create a table using the new COMPLEX type
CREATE TABLE electronic_components (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    impedance COMPLEX
);

-- Insert complex number values
INSERT INTO electronic_components VALUES 
    (1, 'Resistor', COMPLEX(100.0, 0.0)),
    (2, 'Inductor', COMPLEX(0.0, 50.0));

-- Query the data
SELECT * FROM electronic_components;
```
