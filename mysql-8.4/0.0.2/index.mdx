---

**VillageSQL Server for MySQL** is an open-source, extensible tracking fork that is a drop-in replacement for MySQL.

VillageSQL Server builds upon the solid foundation of MySQL while introducing a powerful **Extension Framework**. This framework allows developers to add entirely new capabilities — such as new data types and functions — without waiting for upstream releases or maintaining complex forks.

This version of VillageSQL is compatible with MySQL 8.4.6.

**<u> VillageSQL Server version 0.0.2 is an ALPHA release. PLEASE DO NOT USE VERSION 0.0.2 IN PRODUCTION</u>**
