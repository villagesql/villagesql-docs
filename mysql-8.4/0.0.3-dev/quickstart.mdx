Get a VillageSQL Server instance running, connect to it, and try out the extension system.

## Step 1: Install VillageSQL

### Option A: Shell Script (Recommended)

Install VillageSQL using the official installation script:

```bash
curl https://www.villagesql.com/shell | sh
```

This script will download and install the latest VillageSQL binary for your platform.

### Option B: Build from Source

For development or custom builds, follow the [Clone and Build from Source Guide](/mysql-8.4/0.0.3-dev/source) to compile from the latest code. After building, use the `villagesql` CLI to manage your server instance:

```bash
./villagesql init    # initialize database and seed bundled extensions
./villagesql start   # start the server (default port 3307)
./villagesql connect # open a mysql shell
./villagesql stop    # stop the server
```

Pass `--dir <path>` before the command to manage multiple independent instances.

## Step 2: Connect to the Server

Once your server is running, you can connect to it using any standard MySQL client.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

## Step 3: Install Your First Extension

You can dynamically load extensions to add new data types and features.

Install the `vsql_complex` extension to add support for complex numbers.

1.  **Check currently installed extensions:**
    ```sql
    SELECT extension_name, extension_version
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EXTENSIONS;
    ```

2.  **Install the extension:**
    ```sql
    INSTALL EXTENSION vsql_complex;
    ```

3.  **Verify installation:**
    ```sql
    SELECT extension_name, extension_version
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EXTENSIONS;
    ```
    You should see `vsql_complex` listed.

## Step 4: Use Extended Data Types

Now that the extension is active, you can use the `COMPLEX` data type in your tables just like native types.

```sql
-- Create a database and use it
CREATE DATABASE demo;
USE demo;

-- Create a table using the new COMPLEX type
CREATE TABLE electronic_components (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    impedance COMPLEX
);

-- Insert complex number values (using string literals)
INSERT INTO electronic_components VALUES
    (1, 'Resistor', '(100,0)'),
    (2, 'Inductor', '(0,50)'),
    (3, 'Capacitor', '(25,-75)');

-- Query the data
SELECT * FROM electronic_components;

-- Use extension functions
SELECT
    name,
    impedance,
    complex_abs(impedance) AS magnitude,
    complex_real(impedance) AS resistance,
    complex_imag(impedance) AS reactance
FROM electronic_components;
```
