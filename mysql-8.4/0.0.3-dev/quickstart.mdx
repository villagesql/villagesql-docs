Get a VillageSQL Server instance running, connect to it, and try out the extension system.

## Step 1: Install VillageSQL

### Option A: Shell Script (Recommended)

Install VillageSQL using the official installation script:

```bash
curl https://www.villagesql.com/shell | sh
```

### Option B: Build from Source

For development or custom builds, follow the [Clone and Build from Source Guide](/mysql-8.4/0.0.3-dev/source) to compile from the latest code. After building, use the `villagesql` CLI to manage your server instance:

```bash
./villagesql init    # initialize database and seed bundled extensions
./villagesql start   # start the server (default port 3307)
./villagesql status  # check the server is running
./villagesql connect # open a mysql shell
./villagesql stop    # stop the server
```

Pass `--dir <path>` before the command to manage multiple independent instances.

To set a root password, pass `--password` to `init` — you will be prompted interactively:

```bash
./villagesql init --password
./villagesql start
```

The password is stored in `instances/default/my.cnf` (mode 600) and picked up automatically by `connect` and `stop`.

Use `--here` as a shorthand to create a server directory in the current working directory (equivalent to `--dir $(pwd)/.vsql_here`):

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
./villagesql --here init
./villagesql --here start
./villagesql --here connect
```

## Step 2: Connect to the Server

Once your server is running, connect using the `villagesql` CLI or any standard MySQL client:

```bash
./villagesql connect
# or
mysql -u root -p
```

## Step 3: Manage Extensions

Extension management has two steps: copy the `.veb` file to the server, then install it via SQL.

### Adding .veb files

```bash
# Copy a .veb file to the server
./villagesql veb add /path/to/my_extension.veb

# List available .veb files
./villagesql veb ls

# Remove a .veb file
./villagesql veb rm my_extension
```

### Installing extensions

Two example extensions (`vsql_simple` and `vsql_complex`) are seeded automatically. Install one:

```sql
INSTALL EXTENSION vsql_complex;
```

Verify installation:

```sql
SELECT extension_name, extension_version
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EXTENSIONS;
```

You should see `vsql_complex` listed.

`.veb` files placed in `lib/veb/` are automatically seeded when you run `./villagesql init`.

For more details, see [Installing Extensions](/mysql-8.4/0.0.3-dev/install).

## Step 4: Use Extended Data Types

Now that the extension is active, you can use the `COMPLEX` data type in your tables just like native types.

```sql
-- Create a database and use it
CREATE DATABASE demo;
USE demo;

-- Create a table using the new COMPLEX type
CREATE TABLE electronic_components (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    impedance COMPLEX
);

-- Insert complex number values (using string literals)
INSERT INTO electronic_components VALUES
    (1, 'Resistor', '(100,0)'),
    (2, 'Inductor', '(0,50)'),
    (3, 'Capacitor', '(25,-75)');

-- Query the data
SELECT * FROM electronic_components;

-- Use extension functions
SELECT
    name,
    impedance,
    complex_abs(impedance) AS magnitude,
    complex_real(impedance) AS resistance,
    complex_imag(impedance) AS reactance
FROM electronic_components;
```

To uninstall an extension:

```sql
UNINSTALL EXTENSION vsql_complex;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

Check the error log:

```bash
tail -50 instances/default/data/error.log
# Or for a custom directory:
tail -50 <instance-dir>/data/error.log
```

Common issues:
- Port 3307 already in use: Set `MYSQL_PORT=3308` before running `./villagesql start`
- Stale socket file: Remove `instances/default/mysql.sock` manually (or `<instance-dir>/mysql.sock`)
- Permissions: Ensure files are readable/executable
